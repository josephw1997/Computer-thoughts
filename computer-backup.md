1. Computer install  
Ubuntu disk image: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?country=FJ&version=18.04.3&architecture=amd64  
Lubuntu downloads: https://lubuntu.me/downloads/
MX linux is pretty nice,
try Debian linux,
then Arch linux (to become an advanced user).
Might be good to have a stable linux on a flashdrive and a tester (like manjaro or arch) to learn more about linux when 
you're bored.
Could eventually try slackware after you are proficient with arch

2. Boot  
Option + Power  
OR esc, F1, F10, F12  

3. Partitioning  
parition with ubuntu installer unless you want to long term dual boot with another operating system  
you could even use the 'just testing it out' feature if you are really short term.
Make sure to back up your system before doing this because the partitioning tool isn't always perfect.
