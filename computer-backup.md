1. Computer install  
Ubuntu disk image: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?country=FJ&version=18.04.3&architecture=amd64  
Lubuntu downloads: https://lubuntu.me/downloads/
MX linux is pretty nice,
try Debian linux,
then Arch linux (to become an advanced user)

2. Boot  
Option + Power  
OR esc, F1, F10, F12  

3. Partitioning  
parition with ubuntu installer unless you want to long term dual boot with another operating system  
you could even use the 'just testing it out' feature if you are really short term.

(4. optional) add another account to download shit and be illegal.
This way, if you download a virus, you have more time to erase the computer
(because linux is designed to keep problems to one account)

4. Firefox  
* NoScript  
* WOT  
* AdBlock Plus  
* Permanent Private browsing  (No History or cookies, no saved logins for important accounts)

5. Firewall  ([general security reference](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicSecurity))
* [UFW](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicSecurity/Firewall)

6. [AppArmor](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1008906)
* Mostly just for chromium and firefox, don't go too extreme or the computer will crash
* also look up the man pages

7. Rootkits
* Rootkit Hunter
* Chrootkit

8. [ProtonVPN](https://github.com/ProtonVPN/protonvpn-cli-ng) - Mostly for watching movies

9. Battery (maybe not needed for lubuntu)
* TLD
* Powertop

10. [File permissions](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions)
* chmod 700 $HOME   
* umask 077 (realistically the same as above)

11. No blank screen on suspend

12. The additional apps
* [Github](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/setting-up-git) (use to backup files)

* [Ruby](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/installing-ruby)
* Node JS and Jasmine
* Vim
* Spotify

13. Possible additions
* Check security holes with *"Tiger"* app
* (Ankidroid)
* Pomodoro timer
* redshift

14. Consider making a password scheme that doesn't require a booklet
* like something that four hand motions, changing sligtly per account, 
and that can be traced with the account index number
