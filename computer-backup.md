1. Computer install  
CMD + R while booting mac will allow for fresh install over network.
Try Arch linux (to become an advanced user).
If you need mobile banking at library, use a usb live linux, like puppy linux or the like.
Could eventually try slackware after you are proficient with arch

2. Boot  
Option + Power  
OR esc, F1, F10, F12  

3. Partitioning  
Partitioning when the system is not mounted is necessary, like when installing a secondary operating system.
Make sure to back up your system before doing this because the partitioning tool isn't always perfect.
